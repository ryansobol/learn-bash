## Chapter 1

Welcome to your first lesson -- a brief introduction to Unix.

Unix is a multi-user, multi-process operating system originally developed at AT&T's Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others.

Although it was initially released to the public in 1973, Unix-like variants are the core of modern-day operating systems like Android, iOS, Mac OS X, and Ubuntu.
